I've been eager to build my own blog for a long time. However, it usually means
that I have to buy a domain, find a host server, which costs money. Luckily,
Microsoft offers free github pages so that I can build one free of charge.

Also, to build a blog requires some techniques, so I use Chad Baldwin's template
to make it. [Here](https://chadbaldwin.net/2021/03/14/how-to-build-a-sql-blog.html)
is his post. Thanks a lot!
